When running the application locally, I am an ordinary programmer, I do not know this specific tehnology. (5) application is not working properlly (really annoying broken links, functionalities that should have been presented (excluding login) with wireframes in LP1 are not present or not working (adding, deleting, editing, search, master-detail, listing one type of documents on the page). You have to implement them so that I can feel 
>that those functionalities are actually working (as an user - ordinary or admin - and not as a programer).

# SOLUTION 
Step by step solution explained in words can be found under 
[`docs/solution.md`](https://bitbucket.org/mfilic/v5-resitev/src/master/docs/solution.md).
It contains all we did on excercises.

It is the solution up to the [commit](https://bitbucket.org/mfilic/v5-resitev/commits/9f17e0):
> reset up to the solutions done on excercises

The source code up to that commit downloaded with the following. 

~~~~.bash
git clone https://bitbucket.org/mfilic/v5-resitev/commits/9f17e0
~~~~

or, if you have already downloader `v5-resitev`, with the following.

~~~~.bash
cd v5-resitev
git reset --hard 9f17e0
~~~~

# Quick start

## Download the source code
~~~~ {.bash}
~/workspace $ git clone <URL-to-repo>
~/workspace $ cd <repo>

~/workspace/v5 (master) $ npm install //set express app  
~~~~

## Cerate the local database

### Requirements
~~~~ {.bash}
$ sudo apt-get remove mongodb-org mongodb-org-server
$ sudo apt-get autoremove
$ sudo rm -rf /usr/bin/mongo*
$ sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb*.list
$ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv 2930ADAE8CAF5059EE73BB4B58712A2291FA4AD5
$ echo "deb http://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu trusty/mongodb-org/3.6 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-3.6.list
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install mongodb-org mongodb-org-server
$ sudo touch /etc/init.d/mongod
$ sudo apt-get install mongodb-org-server
~~~~

### Create local serving system
~~~~ {.bash}
~/workspace/v5 (master) $ cd ~/workspace
~/workspace $ mkdir mongodb
~/workspace $ cd mongodb

~/workspace/mongodb $ mkdir data
~/workspace/mongodb $ echo 'mongod --bind_ip=$IP --dbpath=data --nojournal "$@"' > mongod
~/workspace/mongodb $ chmod a+x mongod
~~~~

### Host local database 
~~~~ {.bash}
~/workspace/mongodb $ ./mongod
~~~~

### Import the data into the database
Do this in new terminal. You need to leave the database to be served to access it.

~~~~ {.bash}
$ mongoimport --db Comments --collection Comments --mode upsert --upsertFields name --jsonArray --file ~/workspace/v5/app_server/models/comments-mongodb.json
~~~~

## Start the app
~~~~ {.bash}
~/workspace (master) $ cd ~/workspace/v5
~/workspace/v5 (master) $ npm start
~~~~

# Final
## Host on Heroku (by your account)

~~~~ {.bash}
$ curl https://cli-assets.heroku.com/install.sh | sh
$ sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/heroku /usr/bin/heroku
$ heroku login -i
$ cd ~/workspace/v5
~/workspace/v5 (master) $ heroku create
~/workspace/v5 (master) $ git push heroku master
~/workspace/v5 (master) $ heroku config:set MLAB_URI=mongodb://{user}:{pass}@dsX{koda-mLab-baze}.mlab.com:{koda-mLab-baze}/{database-name}
~/workspace/v5 (master) $ heroku config:set NODE_ENV=production
~~~~


Note that the collections' names of the local and mLabl database MUST match complitely (case as well)!
The database names can differ.
